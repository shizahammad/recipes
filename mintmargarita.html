    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        It's June already and we're well into summers. While we have our rooms chilly with the AC, the temperature outside has risen to a sizzling 40-45 degrees and one definitely needs a refreshing drink to cool-one-down and to beat the heat

Nothing can beat the heat like a refreshing drink and for me it is Mint Margarita - nothing like it!  In hot summers like we have here, this is the best drink to have. It looks fancy but is super easy to make, with a blender at hand and a few ingredients you have a superbly refreshing drink ready.

        It's super simple but it does have its trick. To get a perfect glass of Mint Margarita you need to keep the ratio of lemon to sugar to water perfect. As the drink includes crushed ice too, so its important to maintain the ratio accordingly, because as the ice melts it'll rise to the top and also mix with the water. The ratio I've kept in the recipe is perfect for me as it has all the flavors together; the sweet, the tangy, the mint and the soda.

While the temperature continues to rise and as Ramadan is approaching, this drink will definitely be your instant-refresher and a hit! So please yourself and your guests with this super refresher Mint Margarita.
